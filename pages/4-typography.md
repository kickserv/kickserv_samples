screen applications and should be used whenever possible.

It is freely available on [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open%20Sans).

**Sample**

<div class="specimen opensans">
  <div class="fontitem">
    <span class="identifier">Light 300</span>
    <span class="stylesample normal-300">Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil
      Queen and Jack.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="fontitem">
    <span class="identifier">Normal 400</span>
    <span class="stylesample normal-400">Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil
      Queen and Jack.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="fontitem">
    <span class="identifier">Semi-Bold 600</span>
    <span class="stylesample normal-500">Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil
      Queen and Jack.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="fontitem">
    <span class="identifier">Bold 700</span>
    <span class="stylesample normal-700">Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil
      Queen and Jack.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="fontitem">
    <span class="identifier">Extra-Bold 800</span>
    <span class="stylesample normal-800">Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil
      Queen and Jack.</span>
  </div>

  <p class="paragraph normal-400"> One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled
    dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on
    his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown
    belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was
    hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs,
    pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly
    as he looked.</p>
</div>
